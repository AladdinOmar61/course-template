# Project 1. Your first app!

Congratulations on nearing the end of Unit 1! We'll be using the concepts covered over the previous two weeks to make your first app. It may be nerve-wracking, but remember to have fun. 

## Mandatory Requirements

In order to pass, your first app must meet the following requirements.

### Functional Requirements. 

1. Be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Use Axios to consume data from an external source, and render that data into the DOM.
3. Implement 

### Procedural Requirements
1. Have GitHub commits (documenting good progress) **every day**.
2. Have a well-developed `README.md` file explaining technologies used, approaches taken, a link to your live site, relevant instructions for viewers, and any unsolved problems.


# Getting Started.

##  STEP 1. Read All Directions

_We'll know if you don't._



## STEP 2. Make A New Repo

You will start by creating your project repository on your **personal** GitHub. ([GitHub Docs: Create A Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/))

| **DO**                          | **DO NOT**                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Use your personal GitHub.       | Use your Enterprise GitHub.    |
| Make a new repo through GitHub. | Clone the SEI repo.            |
| Make the new repo public.       | Initialize with a ReadMe file. |



## STEP 3. Research and Choose Your API

You have freedom to choose an API that aligns with your interests or goals, but we have a few recommendations and requirements for choosing an API:

  * First, we **highly** recommend using an API that is public and free to consume. If your API requires membership, granted access, or payments, it may take too much time to actually gain access to the data. Be careful with this.
  * Second, **you must prove you can retrieve and consume data at project pitch time to be approved.**

| **DO**                                                | **DO NOT**                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Have some fun in choosing an API.                     | Choose an API that will make the next week of your life hell.       |
| Consider the clarity of the API's data structure.     | Choose an API that will make the next seven days of your life hell. |
| Consider the thoroughness of the API's documentation. | Choose an API that will make the next 168 hours of your life hell.  |



## STEP 4. Wireframe Your App

You can make your wireframes as lo-fi or hi-res as you'd like, just prove that you've thought about what this layout will require.



##  STEP 5. Pitch Your Project Idea

Before you start coding away, you must meet with an instructor to get your ideas approved. We will have 8 minute pitches in which you'll present your ideas. **You must have your ideas prepared and written up in a ReadMe file to get approved, including the content listed below.**

Your ReadMe **must** contain: 

* Title: A working title for your app. (Feel free to have some fun with this.)
* Description: 4 to 5 sentences summarizing the features, functions, and goals.
* Wireframes: Mockups of your app on desktop, tablet, and mobile. (We recommend uploading to Imgur, then linking the file directly into your markdown using the `!(imageAlt)[imageURL]` format. The imageURL must be a direct link ending with the file format, such as `.png`.)
* API: Which API you will be using. 
* MVP: Write out what your goals are for MVP, including the minimum, need-to-have features of your app.
* Post-MVP: Write out what your goals are for post-MVP, including nice-to-have features that you would like to implement once your MVP is complete.

| **DO**                              | **DO NOT**                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create a ReadMe file locally.       | Leave your ReadMe empty.                                |
| Commit & push your ReadMe up.       | Leave your GitHub repo's ReadMe empty.                  |
| Have your Pitch materials prepared. | Meet your instructor for a pitch without a ReadMe file. |

## RECOMMENDATIONS. (From previous survivors of project weeks.)

> "This is a nice chance to make a portfolio piece, but you don't expect perfection. After graduating the SEI, no matter how great your project is now, you will want to return to it to improve and polish, before recruiters and potential employers see it."
